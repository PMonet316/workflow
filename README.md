# Workflow Manager

Making a workflow manager for Treasury Management Officers and Treasury Management Analysts

The idea behind this is to enable a dynamic support structure between Officers and Analysts in which a Officer or Analyst can submit a project and then an Analyst will "Grab" that project.
